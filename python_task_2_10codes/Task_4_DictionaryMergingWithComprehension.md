# Dictionary Merging with Comprehension Example

This script demonstrates merging two dictionaries and modifying values using dictionary comprehension in Python.

## Structure
- `fruit_box1` and `fruit_box2`: Dictionaries representing quantities of different fruits in two boxes.

## Operations

1. **Merging and Modifying Values**
   - Merges `fruit_box1` and `fruit_box2`, summing quantities for any fruits present in both dictionaries.
   - `{key: fruit_box1.get(key, 0) + fruit_box2.get(key, 0) for key in set(fruit_box1) | set(fruit_box2)}`:
     - Combines keys from both dictionaries using `set(fruit_box1) | set(fruit_box2)`.
     - Uses `get(key, 0)` to fetch values, defaulting to 0 if a fruit is absent in one dictionary.
     - Sums values from both dictionaries for each fruit.

## Output
- Prints the merged dictionary with updated quantities for each fruit.
