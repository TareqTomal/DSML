# Example 7: List Comprehension
# List comprehension is a concise way to create lists using an expression and iteration.
# It can be used to generate new lists from existing ones.


squared_list_items = [x**2 
                        for x in range(10)]             # Creating a list of squares of numbers from 0 to 10


print('Squared items List are :', squared_list_items)      # Printing the list
