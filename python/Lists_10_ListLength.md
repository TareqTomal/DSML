The code demonstrates finding the length of a list using the len() function:




01. Creating a List

items = ['pin', 'scale', 'iron', 'sodium', 'magnesium', 'calcium']

--> A list called items is created with various element names.

02. Getting the Length of the List

length_of_items = len(items)

--> Function: len() calculates the total number of elements in the items list.
--> Operation: The result is assigned to the variable length_of_items.
---> Result: length_of_items will hold the integer value representing the number of elements in the list items.

03. Printing the Length of the List

print('The Length of the items is :', length_of_items)

--> Output: Displays the length of the items list.

Example Output

The Length of the items is : 6

--> len() Function: Used to determine the number of elements in a list.
--> Usage: This code demonstrates how to find the length of a list and store or display the result using len().
