Creating a Tuple

This code example demonstrates how to create a tuple in Python, which is an immutable collection of items. Tuples can contain elements of different data types and are created using parentheses ().

01. Creating a Tuple

choice_list = (853, 'Berlin', ('Hamburg', 90), 'Paris', (42, 57))

--> Elements in choice_list:
-------> 853 (an integer)
-------> 'Berlin' (a string)
-------> ('Hamburg', 90) (a nested tuple containing a string and an integer)
-------> 'Paris' (a string)
-------> (42, 57) (a nested tuple containing two integers)

02. Printing the Created Tuple
print('The choice_list created by Tuple:', choice_list)

--> Output: Displays the choice_list tuple with its elements.

Example Output

The choice_list created by Tuple: (853, 'Berlin', ('Hamburg', 90), 'Paris', (42, 57))

--> Tuples: A data structure in Python that is similar to a list but is immutable.
--> Usage: This code demonstrates how to create a tuple containing various data types, including nested tuples, and print it.
