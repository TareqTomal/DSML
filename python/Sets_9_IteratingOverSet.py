# Example 9: Iterating Over a Set
# You can iterate over a set to access its elements.
# Since sets are unordered, the elements may be returned in any order.

roll_number  = {7, 11, 13, 24, 27}                                  # Example set

for element in roll_number:                                         # Iterating over the set
    print('Student with roll number :', element)
