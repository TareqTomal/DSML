Sorting a Tuple:

This code example demonstrates how to sort the contents of a tuple in Python, even though tuples are immutable. Sorting requires converting the tuple to a list, sorting it, and then converting it back to a tuple.

01. Creating a List

names = ['Ruben', 'Matthias', 'Lina', 'Daniel', 'Timo', 'Benedikt']

--> A list called names is created with several names as elements.

02. Sorting the Tuple by Converting to a List

sorted_names = sorted(names)
sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted_names)

--> sorted() Function: sorted(names) sorts the elements of names in ascending (alphabetical) order and returns a new sorted list.
--> Conversion to Tuple: tuple(sorted_names) converts the sorted list back to an immutable tuple, stored in sorted_tuple.
--> Result: sorted_tuple contains the names in alphabetical order as a tuple.

03. Printing the Sorted Tuple

print('The Sorted names are :', sorted_tuple)

--> Output: Displays the sorted tuple.

Example Output

The Sorted names are : ('Benedikt', 'Daniel', 'Lina', 'Matthias', 'Ruben', 'Timo')

--> Immutability of Tuples: Tuples cannot be modified directly. Sorting requires conversion to a mutable data type (list).
--> Sorting Process: This code demonstrates how to sort a tuple by first converting it to a list, using the sorted() function, and then converting it back to a tuple.
--> Usage: Provides a way to display sorted data from a tuple, while preserving the immutability of the original tuple.
