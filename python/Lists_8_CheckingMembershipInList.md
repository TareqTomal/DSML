Here's we are using the in keyword to check the membership in a list:


01. Creating a List

fruits = ['avocado', 'kiwi', 'cherry', 'mango', 'orange', 'papaya']

--> A list called fruits is created with various fruit names as elements.

02. Checking Membership with in

if 'avocado' in fruits:
    print('avocado is in the list')
else:
    print('avocado is not in the list')

--> Membership Check: The in keyword is used to verify if 'avocado' exists in the fruits list.
--> Condition:
-------> If 'avocado' is found in the list, it prints 'avocado is in the list'.
-------> If 'avocado' is not in the list, it prints 'avocado is not in the list'.

--> Operation: In this case, since 'avocado' is an element of fruits, the output will confirm its presence.

03. Printing the Result
--> Based on the membership check, a message is printed indicating whether 'avocado' is in the list.

Example Output
avocado is in the list

--> in Keyword: Used to check if an element exists in a list, returning True if present and False if not.
--> Usage: This code demonstrates a simple and efficient way to check for the presence of an item in a list and conditionally print a message based on the result.
