This code here explains how to use list comprehension to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable.

01. Creating a List Using List Comprehension

squared_list_items = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

--> List Comprehension Syntax: [expression for item in iterable]
-------> Expression: x**2 (square of each item).
-------> Iterable: range(10), which generates numbers from 0 to 9.

--> Operation: This list comprehension iterates over each number x from 0 to 9, calculates x**2, and adds the result to the new list squared_list_items.
--> Result: squared_list_items will contain the squares of the numbers from 0 to 9, resulting in [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81].

02. Printing the List
print('Squared items List are:', squared_list_items)

--> Output: Displays the squared_list_items list with the squares of numbers from 0 to 9.

Example Output
Squared items List are : [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

--> List Comprehension: A compact way to create lists by applying an expression to each element of an iterable.
--> Usage: This code uses list comprehension to create a list of squares from 0 to 9, demonstrating a concise and readable approach to list generation.
