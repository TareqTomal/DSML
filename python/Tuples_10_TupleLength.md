 Finding the Length of a Tuple:

This code example demonstrates how to determine the number of elements in a tuple using the len() function in Python.

01. Creating a Tuple

items = ['pin', 'scale', 'iron', 'sodium', 'magnesium', 'calcium']

--> A list called items is created with several item names. (Note: If it were a tuple, it would use parentheses () instead of brackets [].)

02. Getting the Length of the Tuple

items_length = len(items)

--> Function: len() calculates the total number of elements in the items list.
--> Operation: The result is assigned to the variable items_length.
--> Result: items_length will hold an integer value representing the number of elements in items.


03.Printing the Length of the Tuple

print('The Length of the items:', items_length)

--> Output: Displays the length of items.

Example Output

The Length of the items: 6

--> len() Function: Used to find the number of elements in a tuple or list.
--> Usage: This code demonstrates how to use the len() function to determine the length of a tuple and display the result.
