Creating a Dictionary:

This code example demonstrates how to create a dictionary in Python. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.

01. Creating a Dictionary

records = {'name': 'Joe', 'age': 28, 'city': 'New York'}

--> A dictionary called records is created with three key-value pairs:
	'name': Key representing the name, with the value 'Joe'.
	'age': Key representing the age, with the value 28.
	'city': Key representing the city, with the value 'New York'.

--> Dictionary Characteristics:
	Each key in a dictionary is unique.
	Values can be of any data type and are accessed using their corresponding keys.

--> Printing the Dictionary

print('The record is:', records)

--> Output: Displays the dictionary with all key-value pairs.

Example Output

The record is: {'name': 'Joe', 'age': 28, 'city': 'New York'}

--> Dictionaries: A collection of unique keys, each associated with a specific value.
--> Usage: This code demonstrates creating a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs and printing the dictionary to display its contents.
