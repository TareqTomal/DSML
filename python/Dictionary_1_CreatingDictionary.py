# Example 1: Creating a Dictionary
# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, created using curly braces {}.
# Each key is unique, and it is used to access its corresponding value.


records = {'name': 'Joe', 'age': 28, 'city': 'New York'}       # Creating a dictionary with various key-value pairs

print('The record is:', records)                               # Printing the created dictionary
