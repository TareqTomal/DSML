# Example 1: Creating a Set
# A set is a collection of unique elements, created using curly braces {} or the set() function.
# Sets are unordered, meaning that their elements do not have a specific order.


choice_list = {853, 'Berlin', ('Hamburg', 90), 'Paris', (42, 57)}       # Creating a set with some elements

print('The Created choice list:', choice_list)                          # Printing the created set
