Dictionary Length:

This code example demonstrates how to find the number of key-value pairs in a Python dictionary using the len() function.

01. Creating a Dictionary

gio_info = {'place': 'Dhaka', 'postal_code': 1219, 'country': 'BD', 'population': 70000000}

--> A dictionary called gio_info is created with four key-value pairs:

	'place': Represents a place, with the value 'Dhaka'.
	'postal_code': Represents a postal code, with the value 1219.
	'country': Represents a country, with the abbreviated value 'BD'.
	'population': Represents the population, with the value 70000000.

02. Getting the Length of the Dictionary

dict_length = len(gio_info)

--> len() Function: len(gio_info) calculates the total number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.
--> Result: The integer representing the dictionary's length (number of key-value pairs) is stored in dict_length.

03. Printing the Length of the Dictionary

print('Length of Dictionary:', dict_length)

--> Output: Displays the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.

Example Output

Length of Dictionary: 4

--> len() Function: Used to determine the number of key-value pairs in a dictionary.
--> Usage: This code demonstrates calculating and displaying the length of a dictionary, which reflects the count of key-value pairs.
