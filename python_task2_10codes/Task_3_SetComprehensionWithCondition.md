# Set Comprehension with Condition Example

This script demonstrates creating a set using comprehension with a condition to filter elements.

## Structure
- `numbers`: A list of integers from 1 to 10.

## Operations

1. **Creating a Set with Condition**
   - Uses set comprehension to create a set of numbers that are divisible by 5.
   - `{num for num in numbers if num % 5 == 0}` adds `num` to `even_set` only if `num` is divisible by 5.

## Output
- Prints the resulting set, showing only numbers that meet the condition (divisible by 5).
