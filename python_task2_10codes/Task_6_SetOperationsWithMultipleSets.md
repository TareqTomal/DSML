# Set Operations with Multiple Sets Example

This script demonstrates performing union, intersection, and symmetric difference operations on multiple sets in Python.

## Structure
- `set1`, `set2`, `set3`: Three sets of integers with some overlapping elements.

## Operations

1. **Union of Sets**
   - Combines all unique elements from `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`.
   - `union_result = set1 | set2 | set3`

2. **Intersection of Sets**
   - Finds elements that are common to `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`.
   - `intersection_result = set1 & set2 & set3`

3. **Symmetric Difference of Sets**
   - Includes elements that are unique to each set, excluding those found in all three.
   - `symmetric_difference_result = set1 ^ set2 ^ set3`

## Output
- Prints the results of each operation: `Union of Sets`,
