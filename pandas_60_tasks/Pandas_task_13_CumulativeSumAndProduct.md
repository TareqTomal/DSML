This code demonstrates how to calculate cumulative sum and cumulative product for a column in a pandas DataFrame. The Sales column represents sales data. The cumsum() function computes a running total, adding each value in the column to the sum of all previous values, while the cumprod() function calculates a running product, multiplying each value by the product of all preceding values. These calculations result in two new columns: Cumulative Sum and Cumulative Product. This method is often used in data analysis to track cumulative trends, such as total sales or growth over time.
