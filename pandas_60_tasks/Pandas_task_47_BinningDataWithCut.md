This code demonstrates how to use the pd.cut function in pandas to bin numerical data into predefined categories. A DataFrame is created with a column Scores containing numeric values. The pd.cut function is then used to divide these scores into bins and assign corresponding labels:

    - bins: Specifies the range of values for each bin. Here, the ranges are [0-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-100].
    - labels: Defines the categories for each bin. For this example, the grades assigned are 'F', 'D', 'C', 'B', and 'A'.

The result is a new column, Grade, added to the DataFrame, where each score is categorized into its respective grade based on the bin it falls into. This technique is useful for grouping continuous data into meaningful intervals or categories.
