This code illustrates handling missing data in a pandas DataFrame using forward fill (ffill) and backward fill (bfill). A DataFrame is created with columns A and B, containing some missing values (NaN). The ffill method propagates the last valid value forward to fill missing entries, ensuring continuity in the data based on previous values. Conversely, the bfill method propagates the next valid value backward, filling gaps based on subsequent data. These techniques are practical for imputing missing values in time series or sequential datasets, maintaining trends while preventing gaps in the analysis.
