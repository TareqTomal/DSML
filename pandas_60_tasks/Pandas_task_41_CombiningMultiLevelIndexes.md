This code demonstrates how to create and combine pandas DataFrames with a MultiIndex. A MultiIndex allows hierarchical indexing for more complex data organization.

Creating MultiIndex:

- Two arrays are defined: one for Category and another for Year. These arrays form the levels of the MultiIndex using pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays().
- The MultiIndex is applied to two DataFrames: df1 (containing Sales data) and df2 (containing Profit data).

Combining DataFrames:

- The pd.concat() function is used to horizontally concatenate (axis=1) the two DataFrames, aligning them by their shared MultiIndex.

The combined DataFrame has a hierarchical index (Category and Year) and contains two columns, Sales and Profit, corresponding to the data from df1 and df2.
